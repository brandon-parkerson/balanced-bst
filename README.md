# balanced-bst 

This project will demonstrate my ability to create a balanced binary search tree from an assorted array.

## What was learned

What I learned by doing this project was how a balanced binary tree data structure is created and traversed to receive information. This project also taught me how to check if the tree is balanced or not. If it is not, then how to rebalance it. 

### What is a node? 

A node is basically a pointer that has data. These nodes can have children and successors that link to it. These links help us traverse the tree.

### How is a tree balanced? 

A tree is balanced when one side of the tree's height is larger by one level or less. If one side is 2+ levels larger, then the tree is considered unbalanced.

### What are the different traversal methods?

The three different traversal methods are: Pre-order, In-order, and post-order. Pre-order: visit root node first, then left and right subtrees. In-order: Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree. Post-order: Visit left subtree, then right, then the root. 

### What do the functions in this program do? 

The functions I wrote:
- Build a tree from an unordered list
- Traverse the tree in all three methods using recursion
- Check if the tree is balanced or not
- Rebalance the tree if it unbalanced
- Add/Delete items
- Find the depth of a node
- Find the height of the subtrees
- etc.
